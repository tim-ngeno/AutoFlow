## 1. Introduction
Welcome to the AutoFlow documentation! This guide provides an in-depth explanation of AutoFlow, a task scheduling and automation platform built on Node.js. 

## 2. Project Overview
AutoFlow is a Node.js-based application designed to automate various tasks such as database backups, file transfers, and notification alerts. It offers a RESTful API for task management and utilizes the Agenda library for job scheduling.

## 3. Technologies Used
AutoFlow leverages the following technologies:
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment for server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: A minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing task data.
- **Agenda**: A job scheduling library for Node.js.
- **Winston**: A versatile logging library for Node.js.
- **Mailgun**: An email service provider for sending notification alerts.

## 4. Getting Started
### Installation
To run AutoFlow locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the AutoFlow repository from GitHub.
2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Configure environment variables by creating a `.env` file based on `.env.example`.
4. Start the server using `npm start`.

### Configuration
AutoFlow requires configuration for database connection, API keys, and other settings. Refer to the `.env.example` file for a template and adjust it according to your environment.

## 5. Usage
### Authentication
AutoFlow does not currently implement authentication. Ensure the server is running in a secure environment and restrict access to authorized users.

### Task Management
Tasks can be managed via the provided API endpoints. Users can create, retrieve, update, and delete tasks using RESTful operations.

### API Endpoints
#### GET /api/tasks

```http
POST /api/tasks
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "task": "MongoDB Backup",
  "type": "Database Backup",
  "schedule": "every 1 day"
}
```

#### Retrieve All Tasks
